# FlakiMe replication package

This repository contains the necessary scripts to run and extract the results presented in:  _On Designing and Using an Experimental Infrastructure for Test Flakiness Impact Assessment_

## Structure

- `$/projects/` : Projects constituting the dataset for the experiments. Note the pom.xml of each project has been added profiles to run specific experiments.
- `$/run/` : bash scripts allowing to run the experiments using FlakiMe against the different projects. The results are saved in `$/data/`
- `$/data/`: Folder containing all the data computed by the scripts from `$/run/`. For convenience all the data are provided to avoid long computation, but they can be regenerated by running the scripts from `$/run/`.
- `$/analysis/`: python scripts allowing the analysis of the data. The output are either statistics in the console logs or graphics saved under `$/figures/` 
- `$/figures/` : This folder contains sample plots build using the most recent results.
