# Analysis

The python scripts contained in this repository allow the analysis of the data contained in the data folder and generated graphics that will be saved to the ../figure folder and output statistics about the data directly in the console.

## Requirements

- Python `3.8.8`
- pip3

## Running the scripts

0. Although not required, we recommend to create a dedicated virtualenv to avoid any conflicts.
1. move to the analysis directory ```cd /to/this/directory```
2. run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to ensure all the dependencies are present.
3. run any script by calling ```python <script_name>.py```
4. the results are stored in the folder ../figures.
